# Project Shell
This repository contains the source code for my small game idea, Project Shell.

## Game Objectives
You have three shells (more like chests in this case). They move around randomly after showing you which one contains the prize. Make sure you choose the correct shell and you can continue! The longer your win, the harder and faster the game gets! Choose incorrectly and your win streak is reset! How long can you last?

## Project Goals
1. Develop a _much_ smaller game that can be done from start to finish
2. Develop better habits without making the game more complicated than it needs to be
3. Be more consistent with using art (using the Asset Store)

## Controls
Mouse: Select shell
Right Click: Pick shell

## How to Win
Select the correct shell with the prize!

## How to Lose
Incorrectly pick the right shell!
