# Project Shell
This repository contains the source code for my small game idea, Project Shell.

## Game Objectives
The goal of the game is to win as much money as you can get. How to do it? Simple, keep track of the item that is under the cups! However, the longer you play the game, the faster and more complicated the cups move. How long can you go?!

## Project Goals
1. Develop a _much_ smaller game that can be done from start to finish
2. Develop better habits without making the game more complicated than it needs to be
3. Be more consistent with using art (using the Asset Store)

## How to Win
Get as much cash as you can!

## How to Lose
Lose all of your money!
